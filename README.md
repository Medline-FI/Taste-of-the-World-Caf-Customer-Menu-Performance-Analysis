# Taste-of-the-World-Caf-Customer-Menu-Performance-Analysis

Project Overview

This project explores customer order data from **Taste of the World Café**, a restaurant known for its diverse global menu and generous portions. At the start of the year, the café introduced a **new menu**, and as the newly hired **Data Analyst**, I was tasked with using **SQL** to uncover valuable insights into menu performance and customer preferences.

The goal was to determine:

* Which menu items are performing well or underperforming
* What top customers seem to enjoy most
* How the restaurant can use data to improve sales and satisfaction

---

 Objectives

1. Identify **top-performing** and **least popular** menu items.
2. Analyze **customer purchase behavior** to highlight the most loyal or high-spending customers.
3. Detect **menu trends** that drive sales performance.
4. Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve menu offerings.
