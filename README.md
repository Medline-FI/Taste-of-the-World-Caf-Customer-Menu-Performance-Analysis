# Taste-of-the-World-Caf-Customer-Menu-Performance-Analysis
This project analyzes customer order data from Taste of the World Café, a restaurant known for its diverse menu and generous portions. After the café introduced a new menu at the start of the year, I was tasked with using SQL to identify which menu items are performing well or poorly and what the top customers seem to enjoy most.
