# Taste-of-the-World-Caf-Customer-Menu-Performance-Analysis

Project Overview

This project explores customer order data from **Taste of the World Café**, a restaurant known for its diverse global menu and generous portions. At the start of the year, the café introduced a **new menu**, and as the newly hired **Data Analyst**, I was tasked with using **SQL** to uncover valuable insights into menu performance and customer preferences.

The goal was to determine:

* Which menu items are performing well or underperforming
* What top customers seem to enjoy most
* How the restaurant can use data to improve sales and satisfaction

---

 Objectives

1. Identify **top-performing** and **least popular** menu items.
2. Analyze **customer purchase behavior** to highlight the most loyal or high-spending customers.
3. Detect **menu trends** that drive sales performance.
4. Provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve menu offerings.

Tools & Skills Used

* **Tool:** SQL
* **Techniques:**

  * Data Cleaning and Filtering
  * Aggregation and Grouping
  * Joins for Merging Datasets
  * Ranking Functions (to identify top customers or dishes)
  * Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

 Key Analysis Areas

* **Menu Item Performance:** Ranking dishes by total sales and number of orders.
* **Customer Insights:** Identifying top spenders and frequently ordered items.

 Insights & Recommendations

* Certain new dishes consistently outperformed older ones, indicating positive reception.
* A small group of loyal customers contributed a significant share of total sales.
* Some menu categories (e.g., international cuisines) had strong engagement, suggesting where to expand.
* Underperforming dishes could be rebranded, improved, or replaced.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **SQL alone** can drive actionable insights for business decision-making in the food industry. By analyzing customer order data, Taste of the World Café can now better understand what works on their menu, what doesn’t, and how to align offerings with customer preferences.
